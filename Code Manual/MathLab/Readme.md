# MATLAB Cheatsheet & Notes

## Overview

This folder contains helpful resources for learning **MATLAB**, from **basic syntax to advanced functions**.

While I began writing my own notes and cheatsheet, I later came across excellent online resources that already cover most of what I planned â€” so Iâ€™ve shifted the focus of this folder toward referencing and customizing those.

## ðŸ”— Recommended Cheatsheets

Here are two high-quality, trusted resources for MATLAB:

- ðŸ‘‰ **[QuickRef MATLAB Cheatsheet](https://quickref.me/matlab.html)**  
  A very clean, all-in-one cheatsheet â€” ideal for fast lookups and review.

- ðŸ‘‰ **[Official MathWorks Cheatsheets](https://www.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/cheat-sheets.html)**  
  A collection of downloadable PDF cheatsheets by MathWorks â€” categorized by topic like data analysis, Simulink, plotting, etc.

## About This Folder

This is a **subfolder** where I originally started compiling my own MATLAB notes. That file (`matlab_notes_template.md`) is currently **half-complete** â€” you're welcome to:

- Use it as a **starting point** to make your own cheatsheet
- Complete it for your personal study or team training
- Or just rely on the curated online resources above

## ðŸ“„ File Guide

- `README.md` â€” this file, giving an overview and references
- `matlab_notes_template.md` â€” a **draft version** of a custom MATLAB cheatsheet

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can rename the template file as `matlab_cheatsheet_draft.md` or something more personal if you plan to continue working on it.

## Use Case

This subfolder is intended as a **learning and customization space**. Take whatâ€™s useful â€” complete it, fork it, or skip it and stick to the top resources.

Happy coding with MATLAB! ðŸš€
