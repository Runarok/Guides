# WORKSHEET

### 1. Write an ALP to generate eight Fibonacci numbers using 8051
- The first term must be zero and second term must be one.
- Add the current term and previous term, store in the next term.
- Repeat the same process until count becomes zero.

<pre>
ORG 0H
START:
    MOV R0, #0      ; First term = 0
    MOV R1, #1      ; Second term = 1
    MOV R2, #8      ; Set count to 8 (number of Fibonacci numbers to generate)

FIB_LOOP:
    MOV A, R0       ; A = current term
    ADD A, R1       ; A = A + R1 (previous term)
    MOV R0, R1      ; Move current term to previous term
    MOV R1, A       ; Move new term to current term
    MOV 30H, A      ; Store the result in RAM location 30H (for display)
    DEC R2          ; Decrease count
    JNZ FIB_LOOP    ; If count is not zero, repeat the loop

    NOP             ; End of program, no operation (halt)
END
</pre>

### 2. Write an ALP to check if the given string of data is palindrome or not
- The output will be `01` if it is palindrome.
- The output will be `FF` if it is not palindrome.

<pre>
ORG 0H
START:
    MOV DPTR, #STRING  ; Point to the string
    MOV R0, #00        ; Start from the first character
    MOV R1, #07        ; End of string (assuming 8 characters)

CHECK_LOOP:
    MOV A, @DPTR       ; Load character from string
    MOV B, @DPTR+R1    ; Load the character from the end
    INC DPTR           ; Move pointer to next character
    DEC R1             ; Move R1 to the previous character
    INC R0             ; Increase the start pointer

    ; Compare characters
    INC DPTR
    JZ NOT_PALINDROME  ; If characters don't match, it's not palindrome

    JNZ CHECK_LOOP     ; If string is not finished, continue

    MOV A, #01         ; If palindrome, output 01
    MOV 30H, A
    NOP
    END

NOT_PALINDROME:
    MOV A, #0FF        ; If not palindrome, output FF
    MOV 30H, A
    NOP
    END
</pre>

### 3. Explain the difference between the following two instructions:
#### a. MOVC A,@R0
- **MOVC** (Move Code byte) transfers the data from a memory location addressed by the code memory pointer (DPTR) and pointed by R0 to register A. The data is accessed in the program memory.

#### b. MOV A,@R0
- **MOV** (Move) transfers the data from the internal RAM (pointed by R0) to register A. The data is accessed in the data memory.

### 4. Circle the invalid instructions.
- a. MOV A,@R1 → **Valid**
- b. MOV A,@R2 → **Valid**
- c. MOVC A,@R0+DPTR → **Valid**
- d. MOV @R3,A → **Invalid**, as R3 is not a valid address register for direct addressing.

### 5. Explain the difference between the following two instructions:
#### a. MOV A,40H
- The instruction **MOV A, 40H** moves the contents of the memory location `40H` (internal RAM) into register A.

#### b. MOV A,#40H
- The instruction **MOV A, #40H** moves the immediate value `40H` into register A.

### 6. Explain the difference between the following two instructions:
#### a. MOV 40H,A
- The instruction **MOV 40H, A** moves the value in register A into the memory location `40H` (internal RAM).

#### b. MOV 40H, #0A
- The instruction **MOV 40H, #0A** moves the immediate value `0A` into the memory location `40H` (internal RAM).

### 7. Give the RAM address for the following registers:
#### a. A = B = R0 = R2
- **A**: Accumulator (Register in the CPU, not in RAM)
- **B**: B Register (Register in the CPU, not in RAM)
- **R0**: 30H (General-purpose register)
- **R2**: 32H (General-purpose register)

#### b. PSW = SP = DPL = DPH
- **PSW (Program Status Word)**: 0D0H
- **SP (Stack Pointer)**: 07H (initial value is 07H, but it changes during the execution)
- **DPL (Data Pointer Low)**: 82H
- **DPH (Data Pointer High)**: 83H
</pre>

### 1. Explain the difference between the ADD and ADDC instructions.
The main difference between the **ADD** and **ADDC** (Add with Carry) instructions lies in the carry bit:

- **ADD A, source**: This instruction adds the contents of the source register or memory location to the accumulator (A) and stores the result in A. It does not consider the carry bit (C) from the previous operation.

- **ADDC A, source**: This instruction adds the contents of the source register or memory location to the accumulator (A) and also adds the carry bit (C) from the previous operation. It is typically used when performing multi-byte addition where carry is involved.

### 2. Show how to perform the subtraction: 29H - 21H.
The subtraction operation can be performed using the **SUBB** (Subtract with Borrow) instruction. 

Here's how to perform the subtraction of 29H - 21H:

- First, load 29H into the accumulator (A).
- Then, subtract 21H from A, considering the borrow.

Example program:

<pre>
MOV A, #29H   ; Load A with 29H
MOV B, #21H   ; Load B with 21H
SUBB A, B     ; Perform A - B (29H - 21H)
</pre>

After execution, A will contain 08H (29H - 21H = 08H).

### 4. True or False. "DA A" must be used for adding BCD data only.
**True.** The **DA A** (Decimal Adjust Accumulator) instruction is specifically used to adjust the result in the accumulator (A) to a valid BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) format after performing an addition or subtraction operation on BCD data. It ensures that the result is a valid BCD value, correcting it if necessary.

### 5. Can we use the "DA A" instruction to convert data such as 9CH into BCD without first performing an ADD instruction? Explain your answer.
**No.** The **DA A** instruction is used to adjust the accumulator (A) to BCD format after an arithmetic operation, such as addition or subtraction. It is not used to directly convert a value like 9CH into BCD.

For example, if 9CH is loaded directly into the accumulator without any prior addition operation, the **DA A** instruction will not modify it, since it does not correct the accumulator unless there is a need for correction (e.g., after an addition or subtraction of BCD values). 

### 6. Show a simple program to add 2345H and 56F8H.
<pre>
; Program to add 2345H and 56F8H
MOV A, #45H   ; Load A with the least significant byte (45H) of 2345H
MOV R0, #23H  ; Load R0 with the most significant byte (23H) of 2345H

ADD A, #F8H   ; Add the least significant byte (F8H) of 56F8H
MOV R1, A     ; Store result (least significant byte) in R1
MOV A, R0     ; Load most significant byte (23H) into A
ADD A, #56H   ; Add the most significant byte (56H) of 56F8H
MOV R0, A     ; Store result (most significant byte) in R0

; After execution, R1 contains the least significant byte (A3H), and R0 contains the most significant byte (79H).
</pre>

### 7. Show a simple program to subtract 2345H from 56F8H.
<pre>
; Program to subtract 2345H from 56F8H
MOV A, #F8H   ; Load A with the least significant byte (F8H) of 56F8H
MOV R0, #56H  ; Load R0 with the most significant byte (56H) of 56F8H

SUBB A, #45H  ; Subtract the least significant byte (45H) of 2345H
MOV R1, A     ; Store result (least significant byte) in R1
MOV A, R0     ; Load most significant byte (56H) into A
SUBB A, #23H  ; Subtract the most significant byte (23H) of 2345H
MOV R0, A     ; Store result (most significant byte) in R0

; After execution, R1 contains the least significant byte (B3H), and R0 contains the most significant byte (33H).
</pre>

# Assignment: Delay Subroutine Analysis

## Problem Statement:
Following is a delay subroutine. Find how much delay this subroutine provides. Insert the delay appropriately inside the BCD COUNTER program so that each count should happen after **twice the delay**.

### Delay Subroutine:

<pre>
DELAY: 
    NOP
    MOV R2, #25          ; Load 25 into R2
H0:
    MOV R3, #255         ; Load 255 into R3
HI:
    MOV R4, #255         ; Load 255 into R4
    DJNZ R4, $           ; Decrement R4 and jump if not zero
    DJNZ R3, HI          ; Decrement R3 and jump if not zero
    DJNZ R2, H0          ; Decrement R2 and jump if not zero
    RET                  ; Return from subroutine
</pre>

### Analysis:

- **NOP**: No operation, just a placeholder.
- **MOV R2, #25**: Initializes R2 to 25. This creates the outer loop that iterates 25 times.
- **MOV R3, #255**: Initializes R3 to 255. This is the middle loop that iterates 255 times for each iteration of the outer loop.
- **MOV R4, #255**: Initializes R4 to 255. This is the innermost loop that iterates 255 times for each iteration of the middle loop.

The delay occurs by using `DJNZ` (Decrement and Jump if Not Zero), which decreases the value in the register and jumps back to the labeled instruction if the value is not zero. Each `DJNZ` operation is responsible for a small delay in the program.

To calculate the delay:

1. The innermost loop (`R4`) will execute 255 times.
2. The middle loop (`R3`) will execute 255 times for each iteration of the outer loop (`R2`), so it will run a total of 255 * 255 = 65025 times.
3. The outer loop (`R2`) runs 25 times.

Thus, the total number of iterations for the delay subroutine is:

# Realizing the Function WX + WYX + YZ

### 1. Expression Simplification:
The given Boolean function is **WX + WYX + YZ**.

- **WX + WYX** can be simplified because **WYX** is just **WX** with an extra factor of **Y**, and **WX + WX = WX**.
- Therefore, the simplified expression is **WX + YZ**.

### 2. Logic Gate Implementation:
To implement **WX + YZ**, we use AND and OR gates:
- **WX** requires an AND gate to combine **W** and **X**.
- **YZ** requires an AND gate to combine **Y** and **Z**.
- Finally, an OR gate combines the outputs of the two AND gates.

### 3. Boolean Equation:
The simplified function can be expressed as:  
**F = (W AND X) OR (Y AND Z)**

### 4. Circuit Diagram:

<pre>
W ──┬── AND ──┐
         |     │
X ──────┘     │
               OR ── F
Y ──┬── AND ──┘
         |     
Z ──────┘     
</pre>

This diagram represents:
- Two AND gates: one for **WX** and one for **YZ**.
- One OR gate to combine the outputs of the two AND gates to get the final output **F**.

### 5. Code Implementation (in 8051 Assembly):
Here's a simple 8051 assembly code to realize the Boolean function **WX + YZ**:

<pre>
ORG 0H            ; Start of program
MOV A, P1         ; Load Port 1 into accumulator (W and X)
ANL A, #0x03      ; AND with 00000011 to extract W and X (bit 0 and 1)
MOV B, A          ; Store result of WX in register B

MOV A, P2         ; Load Port 2 into accumulator (Y and Z)
ANL A, #0x03      ; AND with 00000011 to extract Y and Z (bit 0 and 1)
MOV R0, A         ; Store result of YZ in register R0

MOV A, B          ; Load WX result
ORL A, R0         ; OR with YZ result to get final result
MOV P3, A         ; Output result to Port 3
END
</pre>

### 6. Explanation of the Code:
1. **MOV A, P1**: Loads the data from Port 1 (assumed to be inputs for **W** and **X**) into the accumulator.
2. **ANL A, #0x03**: Performs a bitwise AND with `0x03` to isolate **W** and **X**.
3. **MOV B, A**: Stores the result of **WX** in register B.
4. **MOV A, P2**: Loads the data from Port 2 (assumed to be inputs for **Y** and **Z**) into the accumulator.
5. **ANL A, #0x03**: Performs a bitwise AND with `0x03` to isolate **Y** and **Z**.
6. **MOV R0, A**: Stores the result of **YZ** in register R0.
7. **MOV A, B**: Loads the **WX** result from register B.
8. **ORL A, R0**: Performs a bitwise OR with the **YZ** result.
9. **MOV P3, A**: Outputs the final result to Port 3.

This code implements the Boolean function **WX + YZ** on the 8051 microcontroller using Port 1 and Port 2 for inputs and Port 3 for the output.

### 1. Upon reset, all the ports of the 8051 are configured as ______ (input, output).
- **Answer**: Upon reset, all the ports of the 8051 are configured as **input** ports by default.

### 2. To make all the bits of a port an input port we must write ____ hex to it.
- **Answer**: To make all the bits of a port an input port, we must write **00H** to it. This will configure all the bits of the port as input.

### 3. Which ports of the 8051 are bits addressable?
- **Answer**: The **P1** and **P3** ports of the 8051 are bit-addressable. Specifically, bits from **P1.0** to **P1.7** and **P3.0** to **P3.7** can be accessed individually.

### 4. What does it mean for a port to be "read-modify-write"?
- **Answer**: A "read-modify-write" operation means that the data from the port is first read into the accumulator, then modified (such as setting or clearing specific bits), and finally written back to the port. This operation is typical for ports that don't have individual control over each bit, and is common in **P0** and **P2** in the 8051.

### 5. Write a program to monitor P2.4 continuously. When it becomes low, it sends 55H to P1.
<pre>
ORG 0H         ; Start of the program

MONITOR:
    MOV A, P2   ; Read the value of Port 2
    ANL A, #0x10 ; Mask all bits except P2.4 (0x10 = 00010000)
    JZ NOT_LOW   ; Jump to NOT_LOW if P2.4 is high

    MOV P1, #55H ; Send 55H to Port 1 when P2.4 is low

NOT_LOW:
    SJMP MONITOR ; Continue monitoring P2.4

END
</pre>

### Explanation of the Program:
1. **MOV A, P2**: Loads the value of Port 2 into the accumulator.
2. **ANL A, #0x10**: Performs a bitwise AND operation with `0x10` (binary `00010000`), isolating the bit corresponding to **P2.4**.
3. **JZ NOT_LOW**: If P2.4 is high (the result of the AND operation is zero), jump to `NOT_LOW` to continue monitoring.
4. **MOV P1, #55H**: If P2.4 is low, send the value **55H** to Port 1.
5. **SJMP MONITOR**: Unconditionally jump back to the start of the loop to continue monitoring **P2.4**.

<pre>
MOV A, #45H
RR A
RR A
RR A
</pre>
- **Explanation**: The `RR A` (Rotate Right) instruction rotates the accumulator **A** right by one bit, with the carry bit shifting into the most significant bit (MSB), and the least significant bit (LSB) shifting into the carry bit.
- Starting with **A = 45H** (which is `01000101` in binary):
  - First `RR A`: **A = 22H** (binary `00100010`)
  - Second `RR A`: **A = 11H** (binary `00010001`)
  - Third `RR A`: **A = 08H** (binary `00001000`)

<pre>
MOV A, #45H
RL A
RL A
RL A
</pre>
- **Explanation**: The `RL A` (Rotate Left) instruction rotates the accumulator **A** left by one bit, with the carry bit shifting into the least significant bit (LSB), and the most significant bit (MSB) shifting into the carry bit.
- Starting with **A = 45H** (which is `01000101` in binary):
  - First `RL A`: **A = 8AH** (binary `10001010`)
  - Second `RL A`: **A = 15H** (binary `00010101`)
  - Third `RL A`: **A = 2AH** (binary `00101010`)
- **Final value in A**: **2AH**

### 3. In the absence of the "SWAP A" instruction, how would you perform the operation?
- **Answer**: The "SWAP A" instruction swaps the nibbles (4-bit groups) of the accumulator **A**. In the absence of the `SWAP A` instruction, you can perform the swap manually by:
  1. Masking the upper nibble and shifting it to the lower nibble.
  2. Masking the lower nibble and shifting it to the upper nibble.
- Example procedure:
  - Use **ANL A, #0F0H** to clear the lower nibble.
  - Use **SWAP** or manually shift and combine to swap the nibbles.

### 4. Can the SWAP instruction work on any register?
- **Answer**: No, the **SWAP** instruction works only on the **A** register (the accumulator) in the 8051 microcontroller. It swaps the upper and lower nibbles of **A**.

### 5. Find the value in A after the following code.
<pre>
CLR A
XRL A, #0FFH
</pre>
- **Explanation**: 
  - **CLR A** sets **A = 00H** (binary `00000000`).
  - **XRL A, #0FFH** performs a bitwise XOR operation between **A** and **0FFH** (binary `11111111`).

- **Final value in A**: **FFH**

### 6. Find the value in A after the following code.
<pre>
CLR A
CPL A
XRL A, #0FFH
</pre>
- **Explanation**:
  - **CLR A** sets **A = 00H** (binary `00000000`).
  - **CPL A** complements **A**, changing **A = FFH** (binary `11111111`).
  - **XRL A, #0FFH** performs a bitwise XOR between **A** and **0FFH**.
  - **A = FFH XOR 0FFH = 00H** (binary `00000000`).
- **Final value in A**: **00H**

#### 40.3. What is the purpose of generating the truth table for a given keyboard?

**Answer**:  
- The purpose of generating a **truth table** for a given **keyboard** is to systematically define the relationship between the key presses (rows and columns in the keyboard matrix) and their corresponding outputs. The truth table is used to detect which key is pressed by checking the row and column combination.  

**Key benefits of the truth table**:  
- **Key scanning**: Identifies which key is pressed based on the row and column input.  
- **Debouncing**: Prevents false key presses due to mechanical bounce in switches.  
- **Software efficiency**: Helps design algorithms that correctly interpret keypress events by ensuring that each key is mapped to the correct input.

### 41. What is the purpose of grounding each row in keyboard interfacing?

**Answer**:  
Grounding each row in keyboard interfacing is done to ensure a stable and defined logic level (low or 0V) for the rows when they are scanned. This prevents floating inputs and ensures accurate detection of key presses when the columns are checked for a low signal.

### 42. What is the input to the microcontroller from the column if no key is pressed?

**Answer**:  
If no key is pressed, the input to the microcontroller from the column is typically **high** (logic 1). The columns are connected to pull-up resistors, which pull the input to a high state when no key is pressed.

### 43. True or false. In our N x M matrix keypad program we cannot press two keys at the same time.

**Answer**:  
**False**. In a matrix keypad, it is possible to press two keys at the same time, but detecting multiple key presses may require additional handling in the program. However, most simple programs may not support detecting multiple key presses simultaneously.

### 44. In your program in, how is the key press detected?

**Answer**:  
In the program, a key press is detected by scanning the rows and columns of the keypad matrix. Each row is grounded sequentially, and the columns are read to check for a low signal (logic 0) which indicates a key press.

### 45. In your program in, how is a key press identified?

**Answer**:  
A key press is identified by the intersection of the grounded row and the active column. The program scans the matrix, and when a column reads low (indicating a key press), the specific row and column combination is used to identify the corresponding key.

### 46. Explain the role of the C/T bit in the TMOD register.

**Answer**:  
The **C/T bit** in the **TMOD register** determines whether the timer or the counter is being used in the 8051 microcontroller.  
- **C/T = 0**: The timer function is selected (the timer counts machine cycles).
- **C/T = 1**: The counter function is selected (the counter counts external events or pulses).

### 47. How is the 8051 used as an event counter to count an external event?

**Answer**:  
The 8051 can be used as an event counter by configuring one of its timers in **counter mode** (C/T = 1). In this mode, the timer/counter will increment on each external pulse received on the relevant pin (T0 or T1). This allows the microcontroller to count external events such as pulses or interrupts.

### 48. If timer/counter 0 is used as an event counter, what is the maximum count for the following modes.

- **48.1. Mode 1**:  
  **Mode 1** is a 16-bit timer/counter mode, so the maximum count is **65535** (0xFFFF) because it uses a 16-bit register.

- **48.2. Mode 2**:  
  **Mode 2** is an 8-bit auto-reload mode. The maximum count in this mode is **255** (0xFF), because the timer will reload the register after reaching this value.

### 49. Indicate which pin is used for the following.

- **49.1. Timer/Counter 0**:  
  The pin used for **Timer/Counter 0** is **T0 (pin 14)** of the 8051.

- **49.2. Timer/Counter 1**:  
  The pin used for **Timer/Counter 1** is **T1 (pin 15)** of the 8051.

### 50. If timer/counter 0 is used in mode 1 to count an external event, explain when TF0 is set to high.

**Answer**:  
When **timer/counter 0** is used in **Mode 1** (16-bit mode) to count an external event, **TF0** (Timer 0 Overflow flag) is set to high when the timer reaches its maximum value of **65535** (0xFFFF). At this point, the timer overflows, and TF0 is set, indicating that the timer has completed counting. The overflow can trigger an interrupt if enabled.

### 51. If timer/counter 1 is used in mode 2 to count an external event, explain when TF0 is set to high.

**Answer**:  
In **Mode 2** (8-bit auto-reload mode), **TF0** will be set to high when **Timer 0** overflows. Specifically, it happens when the 8-bit timer/counter reaches the value of 255 (0xFF) and automatically reloads with the value from the **TH0** register. The **TF0** flag is set, indicating that the timer has overflowed. In the context of counting external events, it will count pulses and set **TF0** when the counter overflows.

### 52. Indicate the direction of pins ALE, SC, EOC, and OE from the point of view of the ADC808/809.

### 53. Give the steps for converting data and getting the data out of the ADC809. State the status of the SC and EOC pins in each step.

**Answer**:  
The steps for converting data in the **ADC809** are:

1. **Step 1**: Select the channel by setting **ALE** and addressing the channel (A, B, C signals).
   - **SC** = 0 (input to indicate no conversion started).
   - **EOC** = 0 (output to indicate conversion is not finished).

2. **Step 2**: Set **SC** high to start the conversion.
   - **SC** = 1 (conversion in progress).
   - **EOC** = 0 (conversion is not complete).

3. **Step 3**: Wait for conversion to finish. When the conversion is complete, **EOC** becomes high.
   - **SC** = 1 (conversion still in progress).
   - **EOC** = 1 (output to indicate conversion is complete).

4. **Step 4**: Read the data from the output pins (D7-D0).
   - **SC** = 1 (conversion still in progress).
   - **EOC** = 1 (data available for reading).

5. **Step 5**: After reading the data, set **SC** low to reset and prepare for the next conversion.

### 54. Give the role of signals ALE, A, B, and C in selecting the ADC channel.

**Answer**:  
- **ALE (Address Latch Enable)**: This signal is used to latch the address of the selected channel. It is used to define which input channel the ADC will sample.
- **A, B, and C**: These are the address pins used to select the specific input channel for the ADC. By setting these pins high or low, the corresponding channel (e.g., A=0, B=1, C=1) is chosen for conversion.

### 55. In the ADC809 assume that Vref is connected to 2.56 V. Find the following.

- **55.1. Step size**:  
  The step size can be calculated by dividing the reference voltage range (2.56 V) by the number of possible digital output levels (256, since it's an 8-bit ADC).  
  **Step size** = 2.56 V / 256 = **0.01 V** (10 mV).

- **55.2. Maximum range for Vin**:  
  The maximum input voltage range is from 0 to the reference voltage.  
  **Maximum range for Vin** = **0 to 2.56 V**.

- **55.3. D7 - D0 values if Vin = 1.2 V**:  
  Using the formula:  
  **Digital value** = (Vin / Vref) * 255.

  So, the digital value is approximately **120** (in binary, 01111000).

- **55.4. Vin if D7 - D0 = 11111111**:  
  The digital value of 255 corresponds to the maximum reference voltage of 2.56 V.

### 57. In connecting ADC808/809 to an 8051, indicate the direction of pins ALE, SC, EOC, and OE from the point of view of the 8051.

**Answer**:  
- **ALE**: Output from the 8051 to latch the address of the input channel for ADC selection.
- **SC**: Output from the 8051 to start the conversion process.
- **EOC**: Input to the 8051 to indicate when the conversion is complete.
- **OE**: Output from the 8051 to enable or disable reading of data from the ADC.

### 58. Define the following terminology in DAC.

- **58.1. Resolution**:  
  The resolution of a DAC is the smallest change in output voltage that can be achieved with a single bit change in the digital input. It is typically expressed in bits, where the higher the number of bits, the finer the resolution.

- **58.2. Full-scale voltage output**:  
  The full-scale voltage output is the maximum output voltage the DAC can produce, corresponding to the maximum digital input value.

- **58.3. Settling time**:  
  Settling time refers to the time it takes for the DAC output to reach its final value after a digital input change.

### 59. For your circuit, find Vout for the following inputs.

- **59.1. 11001100**:  
  Using the DAC formula:  
  **Vout** = (D / (2^n - 1)) * Vref.  
  Assuming a 8-bit DAC and Vref = 5V:  
  **D = 11001100** = 204 in decimal.  
  **Vout** = (204 / 255) * 5 = **4.0 V**.

- **59.2. 10001111**:  
  **D = 10001111** = 143 in decimal.  
  **Vout** = (143 / 255) * 5 = **2.8 V**.

### 60. To get a smaller step size, we need DAC with ________ (more, less) data bit inputs.

**Answer**:  
To get a smaller step size, we need a **DAC with more** data bit inputs. More bits provide finer resolution, which results in smaller changes per step.

### 61. In Figure 13-7 of the textbook, assume that R = 2.5 K ohms. Calculate Vout for the following binary inputs.

Assuming this is related to the Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC) for an 8-bit DAC with reference voltage (Vref), we can calculate the output voltage (**Vout**) using the formula:

\[
Vout = \left( \frac{D}{2^n - 1} \right) \times Vref
\]

Where:
- **D** is the decimal equivalent of the binary input,
- **n** is the number of bits (8 for an 8-bit DAC),
- **Vref** is the reference voltage, assumed to be 5V.

#### 61.1. For binary input 11000010:
- **D = 11000010** = 194 in decimal.

\[
Vout = \left( \frac{194}{255} \right) \times 5 = 3.8 \, \text{V}
\]

#### 61.2. For binary input 01000001:
- **D = 01000001** = 65 in decimal.

\[
Vout = \left( \frac{65}{255} \right) \times 5 = 1.27 \, \text{V}
\]

#### 61.3. For binary input 00101100:
- **D = 00101100** = 44 in decimal.

\[
Vout = \left( \frac{44}{255} \right) \times 5 = 0.86 \, \text{V}
\]

#### 61.4. For binary input 11111111:
- **D = 11111111** = 255 in decimal.

\[
Vout = \left( \frac{255}{255} \right) \times 5 = 5 \, \text{V}
\]

### 62. Name all of the interrupts in the 8051 and their vector table addresses.

The 8051 has five interrupts, with their corresponding vector addresses as follows:
1. **INT0 (External Interrupt 0)**: Address **0x0003**
2. **TIMER 0 (Timer 0 overflow interrupt)**: Address **0x000B**
3. **INT1 (External Interrupt 1)**: Address **0x0013**
4. **TIMER 1 (Timer 1 overflow interrupt)**: Address **0x001B**
5. **Serial Communication (Serial interrupt)**: Address **0x0023**

### 63. In timer mode 1, indicate when TF0 causes the interrupt.

In **Timer Mode 1** (16-bit mode), **TF0** causes an interrupt when **Timer 0** overflows from **0xFFFF** to **0x0000**. This triggers the overflow interrupt, indicating that the timer has counted to its maximum value and then rolled over.

### 64. In timer mode 2, indicate when TF0 causes the interrupt.

In **Timer Mode 2** (8-bit auto-reload mode), **TF0** is set to high when the **Timer 0** counter reaches **0xFF** and reloads automatically with the value stored in **TH0**. The interrupt is triggered when the timer overflows and reloads itself.

### 65. On reset, INT0 (and INT1) are _________ (edge, level) triggered.

On reset, both **INT0** and **INT1** are **edge-triggered**. This means that the interrupts will be triggered by a change in the signal level (rising or falling edge).

### 66. On reset, which interrupt has the highest priority?

On reset, the interrupt with the highest priority is **INT0** (External Interrupt 0). External interrupts have higher priority than the timer and serial interrupts on the 8051 microcontroller.

### 67. True or False. There is only a single interrupt for the serial data transfer.

**Answer**: **True**. There is only a single interrupt for serial data transfer in the 8051, and it is triggered when either a transmission or reception is completed via the serial port.
