# âš¡ Parallel Sort in Python

This file provides a template for **Parallel Sort**, a technique that utilizes multiple processors or threads to speed up sorting large datasets.

---

## ðŸ“¦ File Structure

- [`ParallelSort.py`](./ParallelSort.py): Contains a template function `parallel_sort()` designed for parallel sorting with multiprocessing.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is Parallel Sort?

**Parallel Sort** splits data into chunks, sorts each chunk concurrently using multiple cores/processes, and then merges the sorted chunks.

- Useful for very large datasets.
- Implementation requires multiprocessing and merging logic.
- Can significantly reduce sorting time on multi-core systems.

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works (Conceptual)

1. Split the array into chunks.
2. Sort each chunk in parallel (separate processes/threads).
3. Merge the sorted chunks into one sorted array.

---

## ðŸ§ª Python Template Implementation

Below is the function stub provided in [`ParallelSort.py`](./ParallelSort.py):

```python
def parallel_sort(arr):
    """
    Parallel Sort: Sorts using multiple processors/threads.
    This is a template using Python's multiprocessing.
    For large datasets, split the array into chunks, sort in parallel, then merge.
    Example usage:
        # parallel_sort([5, 3, 6, 2, 4, 1])
    """
    pass  # Requires multiprocessing and merge logic
````

## ðŸ§ª Notes

* Actual implementation requires careful handling of:

  * Data splitting
  * Inter-process communication
  * Merging sorted chunks efficiently
* Python's built-in `sorted()` and `list.sort()` are not parallel by default.
* Consider libraries like `concurrent.futures` or `multiprocessing`.
