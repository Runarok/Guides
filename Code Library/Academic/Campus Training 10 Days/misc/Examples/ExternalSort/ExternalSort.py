    External Sort: Used for very large datasets that don't fit in memory.
    This is a template for external merge sort using files. 
    Full implementation requires actual file I/O and is system/context dependent.
    Steps:
      1. Split large file into sorted chunks that fit in memory.
      2. Write each sorted chunk back to disk.
      3. Merge sorted chunks using a k-way merge (priority queue/min-heap).

    Example usage:
        # external_sort(['bigfile.txt'], chunk_size=10000)

    pass  # Implementation is system/context dependent
