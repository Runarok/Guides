# 🗂️ External Sort (Template) in Python

This file provides a template for implementing **External Sort**, specifically the **External Merge Sort** strategy. It is designed for very large datasets that do **not fit in main memory (RAM)** and require sorting using disk-based operations.

---

## 📦 File Structure

- [`ExternalSort.py`](./ExternalSort.py): Contains the `external_sort()` function as a scaffold/template with documented steps. The actual file I/O and merge logic should be customized per use case.

## 📌 What is External Sort?

**External Sorting** is used when data exceeds the system's available memory. The most common approach is **External Merge Sort**, which involves:

1. **Divide & Sort (Chunking):**  
   - Read manageable-sized chunks of data from disk.
   - Sort each chunk in memory.
   - Write sorted chunks back to temporary files.

2. **K-way Merge:**  
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently merge sorted chunks.
   - Continuously extract the smallest element across all files.
   - Output the final sorted stream to a result file.

## 🔧 Steps Overview

The provided function is a **template**; here’s what the full implementation involves:

1. **Read Chunks**  
   Read chunks of `chunk_size` lines/records from the input file(s).

2. **Sort Each Chunk In-Memory**  
   Use Python’s built-in `sorted()` or a custom comparator.

3. **Write Sorted Chunks to Temporary Files**  
   Each chunk is saved back to disk in a temporary directory.

4. **K-way Merge Using a Heap**  
   Load the first item from each sorted chunk file.
   Use `heapq` to efficiently perform a multi-way merge.

5. **Write Final Output**  
   The merged, sorted result is written to a final output file.

## 🧪 Python Template

Below is the code provided in [`ExternalSort.py`](./ExternalSort.py):

```python
def external_sort(file_list, chunk_size=1000):
    """
    External Sort: Used for very large datasets that don't fit in memory.
    This is a template for external merge sort using files. 
    Full implementation requires actual file I/O and is system/context dependent.
    Steps:
      1. Split large file into sorted chunks that fit in memory.
      2. Write each sorted chunk back to disk.
      3. Merge sorted chunks using a k-way merge (priority queue/min-heap).

    Example usage:
        # external_sort(['bigfile.txt'], chunk_size=10000)
    """
    pass  # Implementation is system/context dependent
````

## 📌 Considerations

* 🧠 **Memory Efficiency:** Only a small portion of the data is loaded in memory at a time.
* ⚠️ **Disk I/O Heavy:** Sorting large datasets involves substantial read/write operations.
* 🛠️ **System Dependent:** File I/O, temporary storage, and merge strategy depend on environment constraints (e.g. SSD, HDD, cloud storage).
* 🔄 **Parallelism Possible:** Chunks can be sorted in parallel using multiprocessing.

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Phase         | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Chunk Sorting | O(n log m)      | O(m) per chunk   |
| K-way Merging | O(n log k)      | O(k)             |

> `n` = total number of records, `m` = chunk size, `k` = number of chunks/files

## 🔗 Next Steps

✅ You can extend this template by:

* Reading chunks from large text or CSV files
* Sorting them with Python's `sorted()`
* Writing them to temporary files using `tempfile`
* Merging with a heap or `heapq.merge()`
