This document outlines advanced project ideas that tightly integrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design, Data Structures, and Algorithmic thinking. Each project combines real-world modeling with efficient data storage and processing.

## 1. **Hospital Patient Queue System**

**OOP Concepts:**
- Classes: `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Appointment`, `QueueManager`
- Encapsulation, inheritance (e.g., `EmergencyPatient` subclass), and interfaces for scheduling

**Data Structures:**
- **Priority Queue:** For handling critical patients with higher urgency
- **Queue:** For regular patient order
- **HashMap:** For fast patient/doctor ID lookup

**Algorithms:**
- **Triage Algorithm:** Assigns priority based on severity
- **Scheduling:** Assigns doctor appointments efficiently
- **Search:** Locates patient/doctor records fast

## 2. **Student Course Management System**

**OOP Concepts:**
- Classes: `Student`, `Course`, `Gradebook`, `Admin`
- Polymorphism for different user roles

**Data Structures:**
- **Linked List:** For tracking student enrollments in courses
- **Tree/Graph:** To represent course prerequisites (e.g., Directed Acyclic Graph)
- **HashMap:** For quick lookup of students/courses

**Algorithms:**
- **Sorting:** By grades or names
- **Searching:** For students, courses
- **Scheduling:** Conflict-free timetable generation

## 3. **E-commerce Cart & Order System**

**OOP Concepts:**
- Classes: `Product`, `Cart`, `Order`, `Customer`
- Inheritance for product types (e.g., `DigitalProduct`, `PhysicalProduct`)

**Data Structures:**
- **Stack:** For undoing cart actions
- **Queue:** For order processing (first-come, first-served)
- **HashMap:** For inventory and product lookup
- **List:** For cart items

**Algorithms:**
- **Search/Filter:** By name, category, price, rating
- **Sort:** Products by price, popularity, etc.

## 4. **Library Management System**

**OOP Concepts:**
- Classes: `Book`, `Member`, `Librarian`, `Loan`
- Relationships: Aggregation between `Book` and `Loan`

**Data Structures:**
- **HashMap:** For fast book/member lookup by ID
- **Queue:** To manage book requests/waitlists
- **Linked List:** For transaction logs (borrow/return history)

**Algorithms:**
- **Search:** By title, author, ISBN
- **Fine Calculation:** Overdue book fines

---

## 5. **Banking System with Transaction Manager**

**OOP Concepts:**
- Classes: `Account`, `Transaction`, `Bank`, `Customer`
- Inheritance for account types (e.g., `SavingsAccount`, `CheckingAccount`)

**Data Structures:**
- **Queue:** For processing transactions
- **Stack:** For undo operations (reversing transactions)
- **HashMap:** Fast account/customer lookup

**Algorithms:**
- **Transaction Validation:** Prevents overdrafts, duplicates
- **Balance Calculation:** Real-time updating

---

## 6. **Online Quiz/Exam Platform**

**OOP Concepts:**
- Classes: `Question`, `Quiz`, `Result`, `User`
- Inheritance for question types (MCQ, True/False)

**Data Structures:**
- **Linked List:** For question navigation in a quiz
- **HashMap:** For user score storage
- **Queue:** For managing exam flow and submissions

**Algorithms:**
- **Result Computation:** Grade calculation
- **Randomization:** Random question selection/generation

---

## **Design and Development Tips**

- **Model real-world entities as classes with clear attributes and behaviors.**
- **Choose data structures that optimize for your systemâ€™s needs (speed, memory, order).**
- **Use algorithms for searching, sorting, scheduling, and other business logic.**
- **Document your code and class relationships (UML diagrams help).**
- **Write test cases for both data integrity and algorithm correctness.**
