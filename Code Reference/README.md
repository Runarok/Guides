# Code Reference

This folder contains specific files from archived repositories that are kept for reference and potential future use or updates. These files represent the key components or updates from projects that are no longer actively maintained but are still preserved for your personal use or for future development.

## Purpose

The **Code Reference** folder is designed to store files from repositories that have been archived. These files are kept for your personal reference, to make future updates, or to reuse functionality as needed, even though the full repository has been archived.
