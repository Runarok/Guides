Used For the **quote page**, it's structured and linked the way it is:

> [Live Quote Page on GitHub Pages](https://runarok.github.io/GenAI-plus/Experiments/Quotes/index.html)

**so that updates to quotes or styling don’t trigger unnecessary changes** to the original source files:

> [Quotes Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/Runarok/GenAI-plus/tree/main/Experiments/Quotes)

### ✅ In short:

> The quote page is kept separate and self-contained to avoid affecting the original `Quotes` source, ensuring quote-specific changes remain isolated.
