## 1. Documentation Section (Top of the File)

This is the **first thing in a C program** — not for the compiler, but for humans.

### Purpose

* Explains **what the program does**
* Identifies **who wrote it**
* Tracks **version history**
* Handles **copyright & attribution**

### Typical contents

* Author name(s)
* Creation date
* Version number
* Short program description
* References / sources (if code is reused)
* License or usage notes (important for commercial work)

### Why this matters

* Prevents plagiarism
* Protects you legally
* Saves future-you from confusion
* Is considered **professional coding practice**

### Example

```c
/*
 * Program Name: Hello World Extended
 * Author: Your Name
 * Date: 2026-02-18
 * Version: 1.0
 * Description:
 *   Demonstrates basic structure of a C program,
 *   including comments, functions, and output.
 */
```

> Comments here are **multi-line comments** — ideal for documentation.

## 2. Preprocessor Directives

Executed **before compilation**.

### Two logical parts

1. **Link section** – include external code
2. **Definition section** – create macros/constants

---

### 2.1 File Inclusion (`#include`)

Used to include **header files**.

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // system header
#include "utils.h"   // user-defined header
```

* `< >` → system directories
* `" "` → current/project directory

Why headers exist:

* Avoid redeclaring functions
* Enable modular programs
* Support multi-file projects

---

### 2.2 Macros (`#define`)

Macros are **text substitutions**, not functions.

```c
#define PI 3.14159
#define AREA_TRIANGLE(b, h) ((b) * (h) / 2)
```

Key properties:

* No type checking
* No scope (global until `#undef`)
* Expanded **before** syntax checking

⚠️ Overuse = unreadable code
✔️ Use sparingly and clearly

---

## 3. Declaration Section (Global Scope)

This section defines **what exists** before execution begins.

### Includes

* Global variables
* Function prototypes
* User-defined functions (above `main`)

### Global variables

* Exist for entire program lifetime
* Accessible from all functions
* Should be **used carefully**

Bad practice:

```c
int x;   // vague, global, dangerous
```

Better:

```c
int totalCount;  // clear intent
```

Rule of thumb:

> If it doesn’t need to be global — don’t make it global.

---

## 4. Functions (Including `main`)

### What a function is

A **self-contained block of code** with:

* A name
* Optional parameters
* Optional return value

---

### 4.1 The `main` Function (Mandatory)

This is the **only entry point** of a C program.

```c
int main(void)
{
    // declarations
    // executable statements

    return 0;
}
```

Why `return 0` matters:

* `0` → program ran successfully
* non-zero → error occurred

The OS checks this value.

---

### 4.2 User-Defined Functions

Defined **above `main`**, called **from `main`**.

Example:

```c
void customFunction(void)
{
    printf("This is a custom function.\n");
    return;
}
```

Calling it:

```c
int main(void)
{
    customFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

Why functions matter:

* Readability
* Reusability
* Cleaner logic
* Easier debugging

Good naming helps more than comments:

```c
calculateCircleArea();   // clear
doThing();               // useless
```

---

## 5. Comments (Critical for Readability)

Comments are **ignored by the compiler**.

They exist **only for humans**.

---

### 5.1 Single-line (Inline) Comments

```c
// This is a single-line comment
int x = 10;  // initialize counter
```

Use when:

* Comment is short
* Explaining a specific line

---

### 5.2 Multi-line Comments

```c
/*
 * This function calculates
 * the area of a rectangle.
 */
```

Best for:

* Documentation blocks
* Explaining logic-heavy sections

Convention:

* `*` at start of each line → easier scanning

---

### Commenting Best Practices

✔ Write full sentences
✔ Use proper spelling
✔ Comment **why**, not just **what**
✔ Keep comments close to related code
✘ Don’t leave commented-out code without explanation
✘ Don’t rely on shorthand

Golden rule:

> If code is hard to read, comments won’t save it — structure will.

---

## 6. Execution Flow (Important Mental Model)

1. Preprocessor runs
2. Code is compiled
3. Program starts at `main`
4. Functions are called
5. `return 0` exits program

Everything above `main` is **prepared**, not executed.

---

## 7. Putting It All Together (Clean Skeleton)

```c
/*
 * Program: Example C Structure
 * Author: Your Name
 * Description: Demonstrates core C program layout
 */

#include <stdio.h>

void customFunction(void);

void customFunction(void)
{
    printf("Inside custom function.\n");
    return;
}

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    customFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Final Takeaways

* C programs follow a **clear, logical structure**
* Comments are part of **professional standards**
* `main` is the **only execution entry point**
* Functions improve **clarity and reuse**
* Readability is not optional — it’s engineering discipline
