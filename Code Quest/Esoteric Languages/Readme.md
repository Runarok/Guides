# 🌀 Esoteric Languages Playground

Welcome to my **Esoteric Languages** folder!  
This is a collection of folders, each dedicated to a different **esoteric programming language (esolang)** that I explore, experiment with, or just try out for fun.

## 💡 What Are Esoteric Languages?

**Esoteric programming languages**, or **esolangs**, are programming languages created more for fun, challenge, art, or experimentation rather than practical use. Some are designed to test the boundaries of programming concepts, while others are just plain weird (and brilliant).

They can be:
- **Minimalist** (like [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck))
- **Obfuscated** (like [Malbolge](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Malbolge))
- **Turing tarpits**
- Or just **completely absurd and creative**

Learning esolangs helps you:
- Think differently about computation
- Appreciate language design
- Laugh and struggle in equal measure

## 🧰 Useful Resources for Esolangs Enthusiasts

Whether you're just getting started or already deep into obscure language theory, these sites are super helpful (especially the first two):

### ⭐ Must-Haves
- 🌐 [TIO – Try It Online!](https://tio.run/)  
  Run tons of esolangs directly in your browser—no setup, no fuss.  
  🔧 Supports 600+ languages, including most well-known esolangs.

- 📚 [Esolang Wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page)  
  The go-to resource for anything esolang-related: docs, interpreters, examples, weird history—it’s all there.

### 🤏 Maybe Useful / Niche
- 💬 [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/esolang)  
  There’s an `esolang` tag, though activity is pretty low. Still, sometimes you’ll find helpful or oddly specific answers.

- 🧪 [Cat's Eye Technologies](https://catseye.tc/)  
  A quirky archive of creative and artistic esolangs. Great for discovering lesser-known experiments in language design.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder in this directory is for an esolang I got curious about.  
I'm not trying to archive or document everything—just exploring, trying things out, and leaving notes behind so I can return to them whenever I feel like it.

You might find things like:
- Code samples I played with
- Quick notes or mini cheatsheets
- Links to interpreters or docs I found useful

Nothing too serious—just a space to explore the weird and wonderful world of esolangs.

Feel free to explore, laugh, cry, and maybe even write something beautiful in a language that's barely usable.  
Because that's what esolangs are all about.
